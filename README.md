<h2>Objectives</h2>
<li>Build a performing product recommender and categorisation model using ecommerce purchases data</li>
<h4>Overview</h5>
<li> Dataset used: Online Clothing Shop Data</li>
<li>Model should be able to recommend similar products to users so that total time and money spent on platform per user will be increased </li>
<li>have a model to categorise products correctly since there might be some wrongly categorised products in those platforms</li>
<li>A product categorisation model is used to catch those products and place them back into their right categories to improve overall user experience on the platform.</li>
<h3> Output: Applied K-means algorithm to generate product clusters that are used to recommend products within the same clusters</h3>
